I am a Quantitative Researcher at Citadel. Prior to this, I was a PhD candidate in Statistics at Imperial College London, supervised by ProfessorÂ [Axel Gandy](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/). 
My research primarily involved developing methodology for inference in complex networks. I have also worked on semi-mechanistic Bayesian models for epidemics, in collaboration with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis.
