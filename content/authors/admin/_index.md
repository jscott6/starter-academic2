I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at Imperial College London, supervised by Professor [Axel Gandy](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) and funded by an EPSRC scholarship. Prior to the PhD, I received an MRes from UCL, an MSc in Statistics from Imperial and an MA from the University of Cambridge.
